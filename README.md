# WA_Client
<b>Read messages without marking them as read!</b>
<h2>What exactly does this program do?</h2>
<p>When you run the script, a special Whatsapp client starts working that reads info about all incoming messages, logs that info in mySQL database and outputs it in the console!</p>
<h2>How to use the WA_Client?</h2>

 1. Install the code in the needed folder;
 2. Run `npm i` in the console in this folder;
 3. Launch `npm manage` to set up client;
 4. Run `node index` to run the client;
 5. Scan the QR-code to log in (required only when launching the client for the first time)
